There is a momentary silence. Then Snape\ntufootnote{This is a footnote. Text from http://en.wikibooks.org/} and Yaxley Apparate in simultaneously, each aiming his wand at the other. Recognizing one another, they then head for Malfoy Manor, Voldemort's new headquarters\cite{small}, where he and his Death Eaters have gathered. Inside, Snape informs Voldemort that the Order of the Phoenix is moving Harry Potter from the Dursley home to a secret location the following Saturday, at sunset.

Snape suspects the Ministry has been infiltrated, and is feeding them false information. Yaxley reports that he has succeeded in placing Pius Thicknesse, the Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, under the Imperius curse, a major step in taking over the Ministry of Magic. However, Voldemort says that Thicknesse is only one man, ``and Scrimgeour must be completely surrounded by our people before I act.''

\section{Analysis}
Although Voldemort has gathered key supporters around him, there is little solidarity among them, showing a major difference between Death Eaters and the Order of the Phoenix. The Death Eaters constantly compete with one another to ascend in the Dark Lord's eyes.

Figure~\ref{fig:dark_mark} and Figure~\ref{fig:hogwarts} show how to add two images in one line.

Some are affronted that Snape, who is still regarded with suspicion by others, is invited to sit at Voldemort's right hand while the Malfoys now occupy a lower position at the foot of the table; this is obviously galling to them and shows how far and how quickly they have fallen from favor, particularly Lucius Malfoy, whose arrogance and wealth have, until now, shielded his rather weak character. 

Equation~\ref{eqn:eqn1} is an equation.
\begin{ntueqn}{eqn1}
\left(
    \begin{array}{c}
      n \\
      r
    \end{array}
  \right) = \frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}
\end{ntueqn}

Now the Malfoys must endure this latest humiliation, though they apparently still retain hope to somehow redeem themselves to the Dark Lord. This will likely prove difficult, as Voldemort has shown that he demands absolute loyalty and servitude while offering his followers little in return. Any failure is severely punished and unforgiven. 
Table~\ref{tab:spells} shows how to add a table.
\begin{ntutab}{c|c|c}{spells}{Spells}
Incantation & Type of spell / charm &   Resulting Effect \\
\hline
Accio &  Charm  & Summons an object.\\
Aguamenti & Charm & Shoots water from wand.\\
Alohomora & Charm & Opens locked objects.\\
Anapneo & Spell & Clears the target's airway.\\
Aparecium & Spell & Reveals invisible ink.\\
Avada Kedavra & Curse & Murders opponent Unforgivable.\\
Avifors & Charm & Turns small objects into birds.\\
Avis & Spell & Launches birds from your wand.\\
\end{ntutab}

This has created an atmosphere where disharmony and rebellion can quickly set in, prompting Voldemort's followers to seek their own reward any way they can, possibly resorting to treachery against one another. Even his most ardent follower, Bellatrix Lestrange, is taunted by Voldemort, who likely considers her ``tainted'' for her familial relationships to the Malfoys (her sister, brother-in-law, and nephew) and to the Tonks clan (through her other sister, Andromeda Black Tonks). Voldemort may come to doubt Bellatrix's loyalty if he should ever kill one of her closest kin, which may be one reason the Malfoys remain alive, at least for now. 

Figure~\ref{fig:HelloWorld} shows how to add a code snippet.
\begin{ntutxtfig}[0.5]{HelloWorld}{HelloWorld}{0.8\textwidth}
\begin{verbatim}
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String [] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello World!");
    }
}
\end{verbatim}
\end{ntutxtfig}

In the Order, however, the organization rallies around Harry in a unified goal to protect him and defeat Voldemort; this is far more important than material gains or an individual's status within their group, and it serves to strengthen, rather than divide them.
